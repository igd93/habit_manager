# MVP Overview – Productivity App

This document outlines the key steps to build an MVP for a productivity app using the following technology stack:
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Containerization:** Docker  
The project is organized as a monorepo with two subfolders:
- `backend/` – Contains the Node.js API built with Express.js
- `frontend/` – Contains the React application

---

## 1. Define Requirements and Core Features

- **Target User Problem:** Solve key productivity challenges (task management, note-taking, scheduling).
- **Core Features:**
  - User authentication (registration, login, logout) using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  - CRUD operations for tasks/notes (create, read, update, delete)
  - A dashboard view summarizing tasks and notes
  - A responsive, minimal user interface focused on fast data entry and organization

---

## 2. Project Structure (Monorepo)

/project-root ├── backend/ # Node.js API built with Express.js ├── frontend/ # React application ├── docker-compose.yml └── README.md

- **backend/**: Contains API routes, middleware, database models (using an ORM like Sequelize or Knex), JWT authentication logic, and tests.
- **frontend/**: Contains React source code, components, state management (Redux or Context API), and routing.

---

## 3. Backend Setup with Node.js and Express.js

- **API Endpoints:**
  - User routes: `/register`, `/login`, `/profile`, `/user/:id` (for deletion)
  - Task/Note routes: RESTful endpoints (e.g., `/notes`)
- **Database Integration:**
  - Use PostgreSQL (with an ORM such as Sequelize or Knex) to store user and task data.
  - Define models (e.g., User, Note) and manage schema migrations.
- **Authentication & Security:**
  - Implement JWT-based authentication using packages like `jsonwebtoken`.
  - Protect routes with middleware that checks for a valid token.
  - Enable CORS middleware for cross-origin requests.
- **Testing:**
  - Write unit and integration tests (using Mocha/Jest) for endpoints and middleware.

*Express.js* is chosen for its minimalism and vast community support, making it ideal for rapidly prototyping RESTful APIs while offering flexibility for future scaling.

## 4. Frontend Setup with React

- **Component Structure:**
  - **Authentication Pages:** Login and registration forms.
  - **Dashboard:** Overview page to display tasks/notes.
  - **Task/Note Management:** Components to create, edit, and delete tasks/notes.
- **State Management:**
  - Use Redux or React Context to manage the global state (user session and app data).
- **API Integration:**
  - Use Axios (or Fetch API) to call Express endpoints.
  - Manage JWT tokens (stored in cookies or localStorage) for authenticated requests.
- **Routing:**
  - Implement client-side routing with React Router for navigation.
- **UI/UX:**
  - Use a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) or custom styling for a clean, responsive design.

---

## 5. Database – PostgreSQL

- **Schema Design:**
  - **Users Table:** Fields such as `id`, `username`, `passwordHash`, etc.
  - **Tasks/Notes Table:** Fields like `id`, `title`, `content`, timestamps, and a foreign key referencing the user.
- **Migrations:**
  - Use a migration tool (e.g., Sequelize CLI) to manage schema changes.
- **Configuration:**
  - Set up the connection string via environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`).

---

## 6. Dockerize the Application

- **Dockerfiles:**
  - **Backend:** Create a Dockerfile for the Node.js Express API.
  - **Frontend:** Create a Dockerfile for the React application.
- **Docker Compose:**
  - Define services for:
    - **backend:** Express.js container
    - **frontend:** React container
    - **db:** PostgreSQL container
  - Configure networking, environment variables, and volume mounts for development consistency.

---

## 7. CI/CD & Deployment

- **Local Development:**
  - Use Docker Compose to run all services locally with hot reloading (e.g., nodemon for Express and React’s development server).
- **Automated Testing:**
  - Integrate tests into your CI pipeline (using Jest or Mocha for backend and Jest/React Testing Library for frontend).
- **Deployment:**
  - Build Docker images via CI/CD.
  - Deploy the containers to a cloud provider (e.g., Heroku, Northflank, AWS ECS) with proper environment configurations.
  - Use separate configurations for development and production environments.

---

## 8. Iteration and User Feedback

- **Manual Testing:**
  - Verify API endpoints using Postman or similar tools.
  - Test user flows on the frontend (registration, login, task management).
- **Automated Testing:**
  - Write unit and integration tests for critical functionality.
- **Feedback Cycle:**
  - Release the MVP to early adopters.
  - Gather user feedback and plan iterative improvements.
